Files relating to the work I did during my 2017 NSERC USRA. This work has been published in INFOR, and the manuscript can be found at http://www.blairbilodeau.ca/publication/colocation/preprint.pdf. There are many other code files and datasets pertaining to this work, but at the moment I have not formatted them sufficiently to be publically posted.

CONTENTS
sim0.py contains code for the simulation that matches the current ward process, while sim4.py contains the code for the simulation with the proposed physical colocation changes. Analysis.R analyzes the output from a simulation file, producing plots and metrics.
