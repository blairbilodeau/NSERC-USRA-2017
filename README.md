Files relating to the work I did during my 2017 NSERC USRA. This work has been submitted to INFOR for publication, and once possible I will upload the manuscript. There are many other code files and datasets pertaining to this work, but at the moment I have not formatted them sufficiently to be publically posted.
sim0.py contains code for the simulation that matches the current ward process, while sim4.py contains the code for the simulation with the proposed physical colocation changes.
